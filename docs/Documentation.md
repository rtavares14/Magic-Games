## Documentation

This is the documentation for My Game. It includes information like the main page, the setup, and my game's diagram.

## Main Page

![alt text](<Cover page.png>)

In here i decided to write a small history about a character that fell into a cave in Sintra Portugal.
I wrote a small story about the character and how he ended up in the cave.
I also mention how to play each level and what the player has to do in order to win.

## Setup

![alt text](<blueprint.png>)

In here I have a small diagram of the arduino setup.
I used a breadboard to make the connections easier. 
I used a 16x2 LCD screen to display the game.
I used the btn to mainly confirm the player choice. 
I used the LED and Buzzer to make the game more interactive while giving feedback to the player. 
I used the KEY & LED to mainly display the timer and the score. 
In the image a hired should be also in my KEY & LED but the webapp did not ahd the option to add one more. 
So in my real setup I have one more wired from my KEY & LED to the arduino.
The wired should go from the KEY & LED DIO to my arduino pin  D8. 

## Diagrams
